In this assignment, we will implement a data structure to represent a rational number p/q, and some basic operations on them.

<h2>Rational Number Library</h2>
Create a library to support the following operations on rational numbers:
<ol>
    <li><code>rational rational_parse( char* str )</code>: Read a string
 "str" that contains the rational number in a "p/q" format into your 
data structure. Make sure you reduce this to the simplest form.</li>
    <li><code>void rational_print( rational x )</code>: Print the rational number x in the format "p/q" to the terminal (using printf) </li>
    <li><code>rational rational_from_int( int p )</code>: Convert an integer to a rational number (p/1).</li>
    <li><code>double rational_to_double( rational p )</code>: Convert a rational number p to a real number (of double type).</li>
    <li><code>rational rational_add( rational p, rational q )</code>: Add two rational numbers p, q. Make sure you reduce the resultant sum.</li>
    <li><code>rational rational_sub( rational p, rational q )</code>: Subtract two rational numbers p, q. Make sure you reduce the resultant sum.</li>
    <li><code>rational rational_mul( rational p, rational q )</code>: Multiply two rational numbers p, q. Make sure you reduce the resultant.</li>
    <li><code>rational rational_div( rational p, rational q )</code>: Divide two rational numbers p, q. Make sure you reduce the resultant.</li>
    <li><code>rational rational_reciprocate( rational p )</code>: Compute "1/p".</li>
</ol>

<h2>Continued Fractions</h2>
In mathematics, an infinite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">continued fraction</a>
 is an infinite expression obtained through an iterative process of 
representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal 
of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its 
integer part and another reciprocal, and so on.

In this exercise, we will use the rational number library you just wrote
 to compute some continued fractions. You may refer Wikipedia for the 
form of the continued fractions.

<ol>
 <li>
    A finite continued fraction can be represented as a list a<sub>0</sub>,
    a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, and is computed as
    a<sub>0</sub> + 1/( a<sub>1</sub> + 1/( a<sub>2</sub> + 1/a<sub>3</sub> )
    ).  
    
    Write a program that will allow the user to enter 4 integers for
    a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, respectively,
    and will print the double value of the appropriate continued fraction. 
    <br />
    <b>Input:</b><code>200 0 10 8</code> <br />
    <b>Output:</b><code>210.125000</code> <br />
 </li>
 <li>
   π can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction, with a<sub>i</sub> =
   [3,7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,14,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,84,...]. Let's study how the
   accuracy of the continued fraction improves as you consider longer
   sequences. Compute the continued fraction from the first 'k' values of
   a<sub>i</sub> (given as user input), and print the relative error with
   respect to π from <code>math.h</code>, in scientific notation (i.e. use
   <code>%e</code>).
   <br />
   <b>Input:</b><code>4</code> <br />
   <b>Output:</b><code>-8.491368e-08</code> <br />
