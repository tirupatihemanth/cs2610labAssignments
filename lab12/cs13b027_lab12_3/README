1) The input will have a number 'N' in the first line, indicating the number of boxes given to you. This will be followed by N lines having the dimensions of each box. Observe that it doesn't matter which number is the height, width or the length as the boxes can be rotated.

2) Your output only needs to be a number indicating the maximum height that is possible given the input.

3) Note that all numbers in the input and the output will be integers. You need not care about really large inputs which go beyond the range of an integer.
