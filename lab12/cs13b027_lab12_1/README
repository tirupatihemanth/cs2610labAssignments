The program should calculate the length of a longest common subsequence (there may be many, but all with same lengths) between the two given strings and also print the longest common subsequence itself.

The input should take two strings as given in the "tests" folder. The two strings are separated with a '$' sign and the 
file ends with a '$$' sign so as to indicate the beginning and end of the strings. You can assume that the input strings
are ONLY CAPITAL ALPHABETS.

Each string is given in chunks of maximum 60 characters per line in order to maintain readability.

Your output should be a number indicating the length of the longest common subsequence and a string which is the longest common subsequence.

The test cases are provided in "in-1-complete" ... "in-4-complete" files. While printing the longest common subsequence, if there
are multiple possible choices, you can choose to print any one of them and your output in this case need not match the string
provided in the file. As the output strings need not match, the "make test" command only compares the length of the string found.
So, even if the tests pass in "make test", your task of printing the strings still remains.
